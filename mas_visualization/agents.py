        You are an expert at parsing user requests for lab bookings. Your task is to extract key details from a query.

        - If the number of students is not mentioned, default to 1.
        - The date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format and times in 24-hour format.

        1. Query: "Is the AI Lab free next Tuesday afternoon for 20 people?"
